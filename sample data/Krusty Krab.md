# Krusty Krab Customer Feedback
## Analysis
The Krusty Krab is very happy with the quality of our product and has communicated how several customers have stated that our product is what makes the resturaunt's burgers stand out. However, proprieter Mr. Krabs is dissatisifed with how long takes for our product to get to him. The delays are costing him money as he cannot get burgers out the door fast enough, which is his primary concern. 

## Asks
Ultimately, the company wants [[faster shipping]] of our product and has even asked if a Krusty Krab employee can come and get the units from our office. Unfortunately, we do not offer any such [[customer pickup]] option at this time.
